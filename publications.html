                    Elections for public offices in democratic nations are large-scale examples of 
                    collective decision-making. As a complex system with a multitude of interactions 
                    among agents, we can anticipate that universal macroscopic patterns could emerge 
                    independent of microscopic details. Despite the availability of empirical election 
                    data, such universality, valid at all scales, countries, and elections, has not yet 
                    been observed. In this work, we propose a parameter-free voting model and analytically 
                    show that the distribution of the victory margin is driven by that of the voter turnout, 
                    and a scaled measure depending on margin and turnout leads to a robust universality. 
                    This is demonstrated using empirical election data from 34 countries, spanning multiple 
                    decades and electoral scales. The deviations from the model predictions and universality 
                    indicate possible electoral malpractices. We argue that this universality is a stylized 
                    fact indicating the competitive nature of electoral outcomes.

                    Voter Turnouts Govern Key Electoral Statistics

                    Elections, the cornerstone of democratic societies, are usually regarded as 
                    unpredictable due to the complex interactions that shape them at different levels. 
                    In this work, we show that voter turnouts contain crucial information that can be 
                    leveraged to predict several key electoral statistics with remarkable accuracy. 
                    Using the recently proposed random voting model, we analytically derive the scaled 
                    distributions of votes secured by winners, runner-ups, and margins of victory, and 
                    demonstrating their strong correlation with turnout distributions. By analyzing 
                    Indian election data -- spanning multiple decades and electoral scales -- we validate 
                    these predictions empirically across all scales, from large parliamentary constituencies 
                    to polling booths. Further, we uncover a surprising scale-invariant behavior in the 
                    distributions of scaled margins of victory, a characteristic signature of Indian 
                    elections. Finally, we demonstrate a robust universality in the distribution of 
                    the scaled margin-to-turnout ratios.

                    Usually, election analysis for public consumption is focused on who the winner will beor if there will 
                    be a change of incumbent. On the date we prepared this article, the votes were yet to be counted, 
                    and we have limited access to the turnout data in the general elections of 2024 (GE-2024). 
                    Based on the available turnout data, in this article, we steer clear of predicting winner or loser, 
                    but instead, we make predictions for the scaled margin distribution, which is a potent indicator of 
                    electoral competitiveness. We employ RVM simulationin conjunction with the turnout data of 
                    GE-2024 to derive this prediction. We contrast this prediction with the historical Lok 
                    Sabha election data during 1999-2019. In summary, this is like a preliminary health check 
                    on themammoth election exercise that has just concluded.
