    "excerpt": "This research from IISER Pune demonstrates that voter turnout distributions hold crucial predictive power for key electoral statistics such as winner votes, runner-up votes, and margins of victory. Applying the Random Voting Model to extensive Indian election data, the study accurately predicts these distributions and reveals a unique scale-invariance in margin distributions across different electoral scales."
