                    <p>
                         Voter turnout is the number of eligible voters who actually cast their votes in an election. 
                         Often turnout is expressed as percentage of the total number of eligible voters. However, we 
                         use the raw turnout number through out our analysis.

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        First Past the Post (FPTP) is a simple voting method where voters pick one candidate, 
                        and the one with the most votes wins. It's popular in countries like the U.S., Canada, 
                        India, and the UK for various elections.

                    <p>
                        The margin of victory is the difference in votes between the winner and the runner-up in an election.
                        It is an indicator of the competitiveness of an election.

                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        The margin of victory shows how competitive an election is, but it's more meaningful when you know the turnout. For instance, a margin of 900 votes could mean a close race in a large parliamentary constituency with high turnout, but a landslide at a small polling booth.
                        To better capture competition regardless of turnout, we use "specific margin", which is the margin of victory divided by the turnout.

                        Imagine uncovering patterns so robust they hold true across the globe, 
                        regardless of country, culture, or rules. This is the essence of universality â€” simple, 
                        universal trend hidden within the chaos of complex systems like elections.

                    <p>
                    In elections, most votes usually go to just a few candidates. For example, in our analysis of 34 countries,
                     the top three candidates typically get about 90% of the votes. To account for this disproportionate effect, 
                     researchers use the "effective number of candidates". This method captures competition more accurately by
                      weighing candidates based on their vote shares, rather than simply counting all candidates. We find this 
                      approach particularly useful for predicting the vote distributions of the winner and the runner-up.

                    <p>
                        We can NOT predict election winners with this framework, but using turnout data alone, 
                        we can estimate important electoral statistics like margins and the votes received the 
                        winner and runner-up. We've also discovered a universal pattern in election data. 
                        Together, these analyses can help flag potential electoral malpractice.

                    <p>
                        Across the world, as in India, elections are a volatile mix of emotions, competing ideologies, 
                        and sometimes even violence. Universality suggests that beneath this apparent chaos and cacophony,
                         there is some underlying order in elections, regardless of where and when they are held. More 
                         importantly, universality can be useful to flag potential electoral malpractice.

                        While First Past the Post (FPTP) is one of the simplest electoral systems, there are several 
                        others used for different types of elections, such as the Condorcet and Borda methods. For a detailed
                         account of various electoral systems, check out our recent article published in <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/physics-maths-keeping-elections-fair-representative-explained/article68120506.ece">The Hindu</a>.

                <div class="question">Why study elections from physics perspective?</div>

                    <p>
                        Studying elections from a physics perspective helps us understand how complex interactions between individuals 
                        can lead to predictable, large-scale patterns. Just like how the behavior of gas molecules or financial markets 
                        can be understood through statistical physics, elections offer a unique opportunity to see how collective 
                        decision-making works. This approach can simplify the complexities of elections, making them easier to understand 
                        and predict, and even help safeguard their integrity.
